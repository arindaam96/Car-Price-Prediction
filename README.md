# Car-Price-Prediction
**Goal of the Project -->**
      Predicting thr price of any used Cars based on various parameters
     
     
**Data Source --> **
      Kaggle ( CarDekho Dataset ) - https://www.kaggle.com/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho


**Data Pre-processing -->**
      Missing Value handling
      Dropping Lesser significant Variables
      Deriving new Variable from exsisting variables and using it
      Preparing final dataset ready to be analyzed
      

**Visualization -->**
      Used Pirplot to check the effect on each variables on the other one
      Used Heatmap to get a better Idea 
      Used Co-relation with the ploting to get the significance of the relationship between variables   
      
      
 
 **Feature Selection --> Train-Test Split
 
**** Applied the ML Algorithm ( RandomForest )****
 
**** Used RandomizedSearchCV for HyperParameter Tuning**
 
 Fitting the Model
 
**** Plotted the predicted values against the Actual Values - Used graph and scatter Plot for this****
 Interpreted the results**
